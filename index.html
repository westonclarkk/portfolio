            <p>This site is a portfolio about myself. I wanted to create this to document my life and to showcase who I am. In this site I have pictures of the things I love to do that make me excited! I normally don’t like talking about myself but this blog is going to be entirely about me. I hope this site will inspire others to try new things, get to know me, and learn about different interests. Everyone is different and we can all learn from others, that's a great part about sharing our lives with one another, is that in a way we can enhance or inspire someone else’s life.</p>
