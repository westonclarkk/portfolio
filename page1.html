        <h2>Skateboarding
        </h2>
        <p>I grew up skateboarding ever since I was a kid around 4 years old. I started with my brother’s and my uncle.
            We would go to the skatepark early in the morning and have a ton of fun. First it was a challenge but I
            started getting better and loved the idea of progressing and learning new tricks. I’ve since gone on to
            skateboard in multiple competitions and have had sponsors to support me along the way. Skateboarding to me
            has been a way for me to push myself, enjoy myself, and get creative. I think my favorite thing about
            skateboarding is being with friends and family while I ride. Sharing fun moments with one another is a
            blessed opportunity.</p>

            <h2>Rock Climbing</h2>
            <img src="images/climb.webp" alt="rock climbing" class="float-left">
            <p>Rock Climbing is one of the riskier things I enjoy doing. I started climbing with a really close friend
                of mine while I was in high school. I had an old harness and a pair of shoes with holes in them. We
                would climb at least two or three times a week and have the funnest time! Climbing is an outlet for me
                to learn control and focus. When I climb I feel like it gives me an opportunity to be in tune with my
                emotions, capabilities, and thoughts.

        <h2>Climbing in Idaho</h2>
        <img src="images/homepage.webp" alt="climbing outdoors" width="400" class="float-right">
        <p> Climbing gives me a sense of freedom. I started climbing outdoors during covid in 2019. Me and my buddy got
            super good deals on climbing gear and we sent out on a mission to find the raddest climbs in Tennessee we
            could. We had some big falls, learning curves, and fun while we climbed together. Climbing isn’t as easy as
            you think haha. Grateful for climbing as it’s brought me and my buddy Caleb really close together, we’ve
            built a relationship that’ll last decades.</p>
        <h2>Nature</h2>
        <img class="float-left" src="images/sunsetdrive.webp" alt="sunset drive">
        <p>Nature has always been very big in life! Being outdoors I feel at peace. Being outside has given me a great
            perspective of our life here on earth. I often enjoy hiking outside and going to the lake. When I'm outside
            I'm reminded how small I am in this big world. I think theres something great about the outdoors. For me the
            outdoors is a place to remember the small and simple things in life, it helps me be greatful for God.</p>
