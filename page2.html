        <p>I served a two year mission trip for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints from 2020-2022. It was an
            incredible experience. Maybe the toughest thing i’ve ever done. As a missionary we went door to door sharing
            messages about the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. We’d reach out to people and friends in the church as much
            as we
            could. Our purpose was to share the message of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. As I did so I have
            felt closer to Christ than I ever have before. It was a remarkable experience to travel and visit people who are
            in
            need of help and be able to give that help to them.

        <p> I’m so grateful for my mission trip because It taught me so many valuable lessons. One of those lessons is that
            God
            loves each and everyone of us. I recently returned a year ago from my mission trip and haven't regretted a bit
            of
            it. Taking two years out of my life for God, taught me more than I ever would have learned in those 2 years.
